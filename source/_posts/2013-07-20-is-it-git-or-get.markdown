“Gitting” started on git.  I figure if I practice spelling get wrong I will finally git it right.

Never type in get.  When I do a train goes across my screen and says type git not get, Deb.  Thanks, Jason.

Git is a revision control system
Allows the developers to share the changes they have made
It logs all your changes and why you made them

The three areas of Gig are:
working directory,staging area, git respository
