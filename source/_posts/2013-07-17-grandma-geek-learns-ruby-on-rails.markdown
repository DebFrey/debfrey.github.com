Spent most of the morning working on Pivotal Tracker Assignments.
I learned how to make directories, how to move around in the
directories using the cd command.

I also learned how to use pwd to find out where I was.

And finally I spent time learning to use one command to cd into
whatever directory I needed to be in.

I don't understand GUI files so will take a break.

I did find out that you can only make so many comments in
Pivotal Tracker.  I ended up combining my answers to the
"Learn More" questions because PT kept freezing up.

Another issue I had this morning was when I put in my user name
and password for github (to rake deploy) I would put in my
user name but the iTerm would freeze at the password.
