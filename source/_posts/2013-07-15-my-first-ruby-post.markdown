Today I spent several hours getting my work done
so I could do something fun like start on my homework.
I did struggle some with getting everything right,
but ended up asking for help, which is very important
when you are first learning.

```ruby Cat class
class Cat
  def speak
   puts "Meow"
  end
 end
```
