What I learned about Agile

Agile delivers something that is valuable every week
-Breaks big problems into smaller more digestible problems
-It doesnâ€™t sweat the small stuff
-What you deliver really works
-Always looking for feedback
-Change course when necessary
-You are held accountable
-Product owner tells you what to do.  He/she controls the work and can accept or reject it.
